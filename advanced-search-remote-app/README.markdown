# Advanced Search Client Extension
This is a React based Client Extension of type Web Component that makes use of the Liferay Headless APIs autogenerated for Objects to build an advanced search that includes:
- Account Filter
- Text Search
- Fields filters
- Date filters
- Picklist filters



## Getting Started with Advanced Search Client Extension

Building the React Application
> yarn install

> yarn build

After the build, the .js and .css files necessary to run the application are created inside the ./build/static/ folder. You can then put those files anywhere (in the D&M, in Netlify, in Github, ...)

Once the Remote App is registered in Liferay DXP, you can just drag and drop it on any page

## Required Liferay Objects and Picklists

1. Create the required Picklist
   - Go to Control Panel > Picklists
   - Create a new Picklist named: **Coverage**
   - Add any values to it
   
2. Create the required Object
   - Go to Control Panel >  Objects > Import
   - Import file: Name: EngOpDocument File: Object_EngOpDocument.json
   - Publish Object.
